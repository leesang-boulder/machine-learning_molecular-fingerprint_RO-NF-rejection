# ML_MF_Rejection

1. Clustering - This code groups molecules in a unsupervised manner based on their molecular fingerprints

2. Draw_molecule - Draw molecular fragments corresponding to fingerprint feature number 

3. MF_generation - Generate different fingerprints based on SMILES

4. Model_dataset_2_nested_hyperparameter - Build a XGBoost bodel

5. Tanimoto_similarity - Analyze the outcomes with finerprint similarity scores and rejections

6. new_list_2.csv - SMILES of compounds having rejection data

7. compound_rejections.csv - rejection data with membrane properties, compound properties, and operating conditions
